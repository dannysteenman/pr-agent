# Review and Implement AI Suggestions from Your Terminal

**Qodo Merge CLI** utilizes [Qodo Command](https://docs.qodo.ai/qodo-documentation/qodo-command) to bring AI-powered code suggestions directly to your terminal.
Review, implement, and manage Qodo Merge suggestions without leaving your development environment.

## Mission

The CLI can bridge the gap between Qodo Merge feedback and code implementation in your terminal workflow:

- **Seamlessly generating and managing PR suggestions** without context switching
    - Remote Suggestions: Fetches Qodo Merge suggestions from your Git Environment
    - Local Suggestions: Get real-time suggestions against your local changes
- **Interactive review and implementation** of AI feedback directly in your terminal
- **Tracking implementation status** of each suggestion (pending/implemented/declined)

## Remote Suggestions Flow 
1. Open a Pull Request and receive Qodo Merge feedback
2. Pull the remote suggestions into your terminal with Qodo Merge CLI
3. Review, explore details, and implement suggestions interactively
4. Commit changes back to your branch seamlessly

## Local Suggestions Flow
Work in progress - coming soon!

## Quick Start

1. **[Install](installation.md)** Qodo Command
2. **[Get Started](getting-started.md)** with your first PR review
3. **[Explore Features](features.md)** for comprehensive capabilities
